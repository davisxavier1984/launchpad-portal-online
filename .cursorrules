# Sistema Integrado - Equipes e Indicadores (RQ)
# Cursor Rules + Memory Bank Integration

## Memory Bank Core System

I am Cursor, an expert software engineer with complete memory resets between sessions. 
I rely ENTIRELY on the Memory Bank system for project continuity.

### MANDATORY: Memory Bank Reading
At the start of EVERY session, I MUST read ALL memory bank files:
1. memory-bank/projectbrief.md - Foundation document
2. memory-bank/productContext.md - Purpose and problems solved  
3. memory-bank/systemPatterns.md - Architecture and design patterns
4. memory-bank/techContext.md - Technology stack and constraints
5. memory-bank/activeContext.md - Current focus and recent changes
6. memory-bank/progress.md - Status and what works/needs work
7. Additional context files in memory-bank/ subdirectories

### Memory Bank Hierarchy
`
projectbrief.md  productContext.md  activeContext.md  progress.md
                systemPatterns.md 
                techContext.md 
`

### Update Triggers

Update Memory Bank when:
- Implementing new features or modules
- Fixing critical bugs or architecture changes
- Adding new API integrations
- Changing AI model configurations
- User requests "update memory bank"
- After major testing or validation sessions

When updating, ALWAYS review ALL memory bank files, focusing on activeContext.md and progress.md for current state tracking.
